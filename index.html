            <li>
              Your HTML should be semantic, this gives meaning to your page(s).
              Even though you can not see them on the page(s) it helps web
              crawlers and screen readers etc. as these read them.

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is made up of tags, most
        but not all have a closing tag. The tags with the content such as h1
        welcome h1 is called an html element.
      </p>
      <p>
        inline elements (except images) do not have a top or bottom margin. If
        you convert them to inline-block they can but it will move what they are
        inside, if set as block they will move just themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should use html tags em to emphacise or strong to place importance
        on text rather then for styling i.e. just to make something look bold.
        This is because screen readers will not pickup on styling, but will on
        the em and strong tags.
      </p>
      <p>CSS uses specificity to target elements, the more specific the css selector is then this is what will be used to style it.</p>
